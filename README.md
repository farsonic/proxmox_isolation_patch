*** This code and its need/function are now deprecated. All patch functionality has now been incorporated into PVE 8.3 ***

This is the patch provided by the Proxmox Dev team and I've placed it here with a quick script to install this into a current working system, followed by a reboot or restart of the services on the host. 

Original enhancement request is located here --> https://bugzilla.proxmox.com/show_bug.cgi?id=4300


This has been tested no on 8.2.7 code which removed the Advanced Section in the SDN vNET. Prior versions of this had to patch a different section of code. This has now been changed to reflect this and will no longer work on code prior to 8.2.7 at this point.
